# Setup
To get started with the bot, you can clone this repo, install the packages and proceed to link the npm package
```
git clone https://github.com/AI-nsley69/discordjs-handler
cd discordjs-handler
yarn install
npm link
```
And you could create another directory to test the bot, and link the module to it as follows:
```
mkdir ../test-bot
cd ../test-bot
npm link discordjs-handler
```
To setup a simple bot, please follow the [how to](HOWTO.md).
