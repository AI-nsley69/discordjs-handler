# What is this?
This project is about creating a robust discord.js command handler while also giving the user flexibility in what they wish to do. Some key feature of the handler is:
- Expandable, possible to add your own command requirements
- Easy to use, recommended to run the setup on launch to always create the necessary file structure
- Expand commands from 'template' commands, which functions the same across all the children
- Hybrid commands, use both slash and message commands with a context object to manage the differences between these
- Specify the arguments wanted for a command

# Current state
This handler is currently none working. As of right now the bot aims to be functional
